    <h1>How to use this website/Frequency Asked Questions</h1>
    <p>This is a collaborative storytelling website. You must register to use this site. Once you do, log in.</p>
    <p>After doing so, you will be brought to a landing page (your "personal" page). From here, you choose to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>View the other stories present on this website</li>
      <li>Create a new story</li>
      <li>Read the stories you've personally contributed to</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When viewing the other stories on this website, you will only be shown
       the latest update to a story and the person that made that update.
       You will not be shown the whole thing. From here, you can choose to
       add to it yourself. There is a 50-word limit to your update.</p>
    <p>Note that you will not be allowed to update a story you've contributed to
       already. No problem, as the instant you successfully submit your update
       or create a story, you can access it on your landing page in its entirety.</p>
